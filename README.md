# Saint-Petersburg-craft-beer
The difference in the popularity of craft beer brands is an interesting topic to explore. Using the dataset which represents user activity via check-ins of beer in bars it's possible to see which beer brands are espacially popular in various bars in my hometown Saint-Petersburg.<br/>
<br/>
The aim of this mini-project was to take a look to find out what kind of beer people drink in different bars of St. Petersburg.<br/>
I decided to answer the following questions:<br/>
•	Which beers and bars are the most popular and most highly rated in Saint Petersburg?<br/>
•	Which breweries produce the best beers in the opinion of the residents of St. Petersburg?<br/>
•	Is there any difference in popularity of beer brands in various bars? <br/>
